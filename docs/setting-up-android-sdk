# Getting the Android SDK

## On OSX

* You can use [brew][1] (`brew install android`)  or get the SDK from the [android developer hub][2]
* Once you have installed the SDK run the SDK Manager (`android sdk`)
  * You will want to have a version of the API with version greater or equal to 17
  * Check out [the docs][3] for the SDK Manager for more information on the subject
* Then you will need to export `$ANDROID_HOME`
  * If you used brew:
	
		`export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/r21.1`
  
  * Or else export the folder you unzipped your SDK to
* The next step is creating your virtual device

	`android create avd -n <name> -t <id> -b x86`

* Now you can go ahead and run your avd

	`emulator @<name>`

## On Linux 

This should be pretty similar to OSX.

Notes:

* For Ubuntu, you can `apt-get install android-tools-adb` but you will still need the SDK Manager. So getting it all from the [android developper hub][2] should be simpler (and insure your version is up to date).
